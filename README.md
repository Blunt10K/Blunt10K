Hi, Iâ€™m Kenny. I'm a recent AI graduate currently in Zimbabwe. 

I'm interested in data science and analytics, robotics, AI applications and have a passing interest in operating systems and networks.

I'm currently developing scalable data and analytics pipelines because I have an interest in all the aspects invovled in data-driven decisions. I would like to infuse AI and ML in the process, so they will likely pop up in many of the projects I participate in.

I mostly use Python and will include any case studies I am working on in my repositories. I aim to grow into a professional practitioner, building production-grade solutions to a multitude of tasks and I've already started on this path. I am interested in optimising the use of resources but I am open to any type of problem to help keep my mind agile. 

Feel free to browse through my repositories and view my projects.
