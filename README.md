Hi, I’m Kenny. I'm a recent AI graduate currently in the Netherlands. 

I'm interested in data science, robotics, AI applications and have a passing interest in operating systems and networks.

I'm currently learning SQL and delving deeper into NLP.  

I aspire to build production-grade solutions to a multitude of problems.
I am mostly interested in optimising the use of resources but I am open to any type of problem to help keep my mind agile. 

Feel free to browse through my public repositories.
